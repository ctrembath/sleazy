1. npm install bower 
	(put node modules in your .gitignore)

2. add bower-rails  and angular to the Gemfile by typing:

		gem 'bower-rails'
		gem 'angular-rails-templates'

3. do bundle install

4. install angular dependencies(the following will create the bower.json file)

 	rails g bower_rails:initialize json

5. add angular to your json file

6. run:
 bundle exec rake bower:install

 7a. bin/rake db:create
 7b. bin/rake db:create RAILS_ENV=test

8. we now need to remove the .js.coffee files since we have realised that we do not need them (was just a more rubish way to do stuff, but we love JS)
